# Bitbox

Bitbox is currently just a register based virtual machine.  The goal of the project is to have a target IR (intermediate representation) to compile your language to and then provide you with a VM and a way to target native code.

#### Header
| offset | size | purpose                                       |
|:-------|:----:|:---------------------------------------------:|
|  0x00  |  4   | 0x42, 0x42, 0x4f, 0x58 in ASCII these four bytes constitute the magic number.|
|  0x04  |  4   | How big the .data section is                  |
|  0x08  |  4   | Entry point into .text section                |
|  0x0C  |  52  | Not used section                              |

#### Insturctions Supported

Instructions consist of a 3 main parts.

1. **Code**: this is one byte
2. **Type**: this is one byte
  - if `type` is 0b1000_0000 then type is signed integer
  - if `type` is 0x00 then there are no args
3. **Args**: this is one byte to as many bytes as needed
  - **Arg 1**: this is one byte
  - **Arg 2**: this is two bytes
  - **Arg 3**: this is three bytes
  - **Arg 1 with Immediate Value**: this is one to as many bytes as needed. The type will dictate the size.
